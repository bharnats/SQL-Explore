# SQL-Explore
## Objective:
Query the sakila movie database that comes as a sample with MySQL.

## Background
The Sakila sample database was initially developed by Mike Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL AB documentation team, and is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth. 
Development of the Sakila sample database began in early 2005. Early designs were based on the database used in the Dell whitepaper Three Approaches to MySQL Applications on Dell PowerEdge Servers.Where Dell's sample database was designed to represent an online DVD store, the Sakila sample database is designed to represent a DVD rental store. The Sakila sample database still borrows film and actor names from the Dell sample database.
